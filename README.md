##Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the difference in temperature for months of December and June for the surf shop. Overall, the location has fairly consistent temperatures.

The average temperature:

•	June: 75 degrees
•	December: 71 degrees

The lowest temperature:

•	June: 64 degrees
•	December: 56 degrees

December sales may be impacted by lower average temperature. Other queries to run would include precipitation amounts as it is another event that may impact sales.
